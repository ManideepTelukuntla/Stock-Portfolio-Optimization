# Stock Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing a stock portfolio to closely track the NASDAQ-100 index using Integer Programming. The approach involves selecting stocks and optimizing their weights with Gurobi to minimize tracking error.

## Team
- Manideep Telukuntla
- Krittika Deshwal
- Milind Bhatia
- Chih-En Ko

## Objective
To create a stock portfolio that mimics the NASDAQ-100 index, balancing tracking accuracy and portfolio simplicity.

## Methodology
- **Stock Selection and Weight Optimization**: Picking stocks and calculating optimal weights.
- **Mixed Integer Program**: An alternative method without pre-selecting stocks.

## Analysis
- **Data Preprocessing**: Using 2019 and 2020 datasets.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing portfolio performance with different stock counts.
- **Recommendations & Comparisons**: Evaluating various portfolio construction methods.

## Conclusion
The project showcases effective index fund construction techniques, highlighting the balance between tracking accuracy and portfolio complexity. Optimal results were obtained with a balanced stock number, considering both in-sample and out-of-sample performance and practical portfolio management aspects.
